- Built a CNN model to classify flower images into respective classes
- Dataset was obtained from kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition
- Used Transfer Learning on a pre-trained ResNet50 model , implementation done in PyTorch
- Also performed feature extraction on the entire dataset using the model (which maybe used for optimization to further improve the model's performance) 
- Achieved accuracy of <b>99.76%</b> on training dataset and <b>94.34%</b> on validation dataset
